### Workshop Topics

This workshop, 'Differential Expression Analysis Using Bioconductor Workshop', is designed to expand upon the Bioconductor training provided in the first Bioconductor workshop; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  The topics presented herein include the following:

* Standard differential expression and ontology analysis
